<h1 style="font-family: Abril Fatface;"><u><b><center><b>My Work</b></center></u> </h1>



&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="font-family: Abril Fatface;"> <center>In 2017 I completed a BSc undergraduate degree in Psychology.
   After learning about Social, Forensic and Clinical Psychology, I was interested in the interconnectedness
   different disciplins when studying war and conflict. Tactics such as terrorism cannot be fully understood
   until all variables are understood spanning across Psychology, War studies, International Relations, Politics,
   History, Media, Religion ect. Understanging the multi-disiplinary nature of war and conflict is key to understanding
   the root cause of these current problems. Below are some examples of my previous and current works pertaining to
   the study of war and conflict through a psychological perspective or the effects of war or conflict on mental health.
   I am currently completing a Master's course in London at King's College London in War and Psychiatry. My dissertaion is
   focusing on the current increased threat from far-right extremism in the UK, why people are attracted to far-right
   organizations and who is must vulnerable to recruitment. This website aims to answer some difficult questions in relation
   to war and terrorism using a psyhcological perspective. All pieces of work combine many different
   disciplines using multi-disciplinary theories. I do not give permission for any of my work to be reused
   without written permission. </center>

<h1>What are the psychological recruitment techniques used by the Islamic State?</h1>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<h3>Historical context:</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
The Islamic State (IS) is an Islamic terrorist group currently operating in Syria and Iraq (Brisard & Martinez, 2014; BBC, 2017). The term terrorism is problematic and there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes terrorist activity. Terrorism can be defined as an act of violence with the intension of unlawfully attacking civilians for political gain. Islamic terrorism can be defined as any group that is considered a terrorist organization which is motivated and based on professed Islamic beliefs (Venkatraman, 2007), and Jihad (within the context of Islamic terrorism), is defined as a war against infidels on behalf of Islam (Kepel, 2006). Lastly, the term IS, is itself a self-given name. Other titles used to describe the terrorist organization include Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and Daesh (which is considered the most neutral term).
</p>

<p>
The IS is notorious for its extremist ideology concerning the treatment of infidels, women, and the eradication of historical artefacts and culture (Atwan, 2015). The IS was established in 1999 under the name Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad by an al-Qaeda recruit called Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. In 2007-2008, US forces killed Zarqawi (Burns, 2006 June 8), and the majority of his followers during the invasion of Iraq under Operation Iraqi Freedom, causing the IS to retreat underground. The IS did not re-emerge until Obama declared the withdrawal of all US troops from the Iraqi region by 2011 (Hashim, 2014). By 2013, the IS had taken control of large sections of Syria and proceeded to invade Iraq, taking Mosul, in 2014 (Hashim, 2014). 2015 saw an increase in attention from main-stream media (MSM) in relation to foreign terrorist attacks across the world. However, in 2015 the IS began to lose ground (shown in figure 1 and 2) as more opposition states and groups became involved in the Syrian civil war (Hutt, 2016).
</p>

<p>
Recruitment is central to the success of terrorist groups, and psychological tactics are key to IS recruitment (Atwan, 2015). In 2015, approximately 20,000 individuals from 90 countries travelled to join the IS in Iraq and Syria (Van Ginkel, 2015), and this figure has risen to 30,000 foreign fighters from more than 100 countries in 2017 (McDowell-Smith, Speckhard, & Yayla, 2017). These fighters migrate from all over the world (figure 3), proving its success in worldwide recruitment.
</p>

<p>
 Although there are different psychological techniques utilized by the IS, because of its keen application of technology, this essay will focus on the following three psychological recruitment areas; recruitment through the internet, main-stream media (MSM) and formal media, and the use of islamophobia as a recruitment tool.
</p>

<h3>Recruitment through the internet</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Recruitment no longer needs to occur in the physical world. People communicate via the internet, unware of the other person's identity (McDowell-Smith et al., 2017). In the physical world, closed circuit television (CCTV) operates which can follow the trajectory of a person of interest (Norris & Moran, 2016). The United Kingdom (UK) is the most surveilled nation on earth (Gilbert, 2017; Johnston, 2006), and therefore, capturing illegal activity in physical space is probable. However, this effective surveillance is more difficult in cyberspace where the majority of recruiters operate (Morris, 2017). Encryption, incorporated into all social media platforms, make it difficult for government operators to observe criminal activity, making it easier for the IS to recruit vulnerable people online (Bartlett & Krasodomski-Jones, 2015).
 There are many reasons why the IS uses the internet for recruitment. McDowell-Smith et al., (2017) outlines five main reasons.
</p>

<p>
1) The opportunity for more vulnerable people to become radicalized</li>
2) Social media functions as an echo chamber reflecting ones own opinions
3) It increases the speed of radicalization
4) No physical contact/interaction needed
5) The ability for people to self-radicalize
</p>

<p>
One of the main reasons the IS has been effective in recruiting young people has been their keen application of social media and other modern propaganda tools that enable wide-spread dissemination of their ideology (Rose, 2014). Most foreign recruits attracted to the IS are in their late teens and early twenties. This age group is one of the most technology-orientated with 89% active online, and 70% of people using social networking sights daily (Atwan, 2015). The IS uses the internet for two purposes; marketing through social media and disseminating formal propaganda through videos, magazines, articles, blogs ect. Marketing on social media can be divided into two categories; formal and informal marketing. Formal marketing relates to any information directly distributed by the IS, whereas informal marketing is IS-related propaganda distributed by IS followers (Atwan, 2015). Formal marketing through Dabiq (the official magazine of the IS), and other propaganda-related material, are the first steps to capturing the attention of individuals who may be questioning the narrative of the West (Ristori, n.d). Cognitive psychology shows that individuals are more attentive towards information that grabs their attention, especially if the content information is exciting and novel (Smith, 2012). This reflects the nature of IS propaganda disseminated on social media, such as images of brutal executions and images depicting children in Jihad (figure 4).
Figure 4. Child soldiers of the IS (Chastian, 2016).
<p>

<p>
The IS employs memes as one of their propaganda tools on the internet. A meme can be defined as a form of media which has a caption that is usually satirical in nature and is disseminated across the internet (Stevens, 2015). The IS uses the hashtag #CatsofJihad which are images of cats with weapons such as guns and grenades (Ristori, n.d) (figure 5). It is argued that these softer recruitment techniques of the IS have been circulated for years but do not received as much airtime and attention due to the lack of brutality in the images (Dearden, 2016). The popular game 'Call of Duty' is also parodied by the IS through various war-related images. A picture of two soldiers Is used to attract young recruits with the words "This is our Call of Duty, and we Respawn in Jannah (Heaven)" which is a clear reference to the popular war game (Ristori, n.d) (Figure 6).
</p>

<p>
These propaganda tools, aimed at potential young recruits, are used to attract attention and normalize the situational brutality through making the ideas and images of the IS familiar. By including humour (#catsofjihad) and popular video games (Call of duty) into the recruitment strategy, the IS appeals to a much younger audience (normally adolescents) who may be more naïve and innocent, and therefore easier to groom (Whittle, Hamilton-Giachritsis, Beech, & Collings, 2013). The Call of Duty poster also plays on the sense of adventure and excitement potentially aimed at attracting young male recruits (Hashim, 2014).
</p>

<h3>Social media</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
As discussed above, social media is one of the main recruitment strategies employed by the IS through informal and formal marketing. Social media (Twitter, Facebook, Telegraph ect) is accessed through the internet and is therefore a form of online recruitment (McDowell-Smith, Speckhard, & Yayla, 2017). One of the main strategies of the IS involves the exposure of their ideology to as many people as possible through social media platforms. IS supporters are important in disseminating ideological information through informal media such as social media platforms, most notably Twitter. An example of this was the use of hashtags on twitter during the Scottish referendum in 2014. IS followers reportedly used hashtags on twitter leading up to the Scottish referendum such as #voteyes or #voteno. This exposed people using these hashtags to potential IS propaganda through their twitter feed or profile (Atwan, 2015). Twitter is an interconnected network of profiles across the world all sharing information. When a hashtag is used (with a message attached), this message then appears on the feed relating to that hashtag (Kywe, Hoang, Lim, & Zhu, 2012). Any individual who therefore uses the hashtag will be exposed to all messages that have been shared on that feed.
</p>

<p>
Berger (2015) defines five main stages to IS online recruitment; discovery, micro-community, isolation, encryption, identification and encouragement of action. Discovery involves the initial discovery of a target by an IS recruiter or the discovery of the IS through recruitment devices such as #voteyes or #catsofjihad. This is usually done by cyber stalking a target on Twitter or Facebook. This is followed by the creation of a micro-community involving the IS recruiter gathering other IS supporters to input their opinion into the conversation to create a biased, one-sided perception of the IS through an echo chamber. Third is isolation. Once the connection has been made, potential recruits are advised to cut ties with influential or mainstream influences including religious local communities, friends and family. The elimination of outside threats (opposing views) ensures vulnerability of the target, a sense of loyalty to the group due to the need for protection from the group, and a need to belong due to the forced isolation from other social groups. Next is the transition onto an encrypted piece of communication software ensuring private communication between the potential recruits and the recruiter. This uses encrypted messaging platforms such as Whatsapp or Kik (Atwan, 2015). The last stage includes identification and encouragement of action. This stage involves the IS supporters establishing what the new recruit is willing to do (for example, join the IS in Syria or conduct a home attack in their home country). The target is then persuaded to take action which may lead to the threat of negative consequences if action is not taken (Berger, 2015).
</p>

<p>
Regarding the discovery stage, exposure to the IS through familiar hashtags reflects the selective exposure theory (Barberá, 2014). If individuals are exposed to IS propaganda as part of a political movement in their country (such as the Scottish referendum), then it is likely that the information will be trusted, especially if it reflects their own political standpoint, as was the case with #voteyes or #voteno. Research shows that people are less likely to critically engage with information if it reflects their political view (Dylko, 2015). It is likely that the IS propaganda will not be obviously related to the IS, thereby increasing the perceieved reliability of the source. The later stages of Berger's (2015) model play on the in-group, out-group theory whereby the targeted individual becomes one of the in-group, and those who are not in the group may be dehumanized. This can result in to perceiving certain people as less than human, which then enables an increased level of violence against the group/individual (Bastian & Haslam, 2010). This feeling of in-group membership is increased through social identity wherein a person's sense of self-worth and importance is based on their social membership to a group (Abrams & Hogg, 1990). This is strengthened by the increased isolation of the target from their previous connections ensuring enhanced dependency on the group. The increased in-out group rhetoric can lead to the dehumanization of the out-group by capitalizing on the "us and them" narrative (Bar-Tal, 2000). The need to feel significant and part of a prestigious group is a known technique used to train torturers. This feeling of elitism leads to group cohesion and increased trust in the other individual's abilities to carry out a task (Wagner, 1983). It also leads to further isolation from out-group members and a feeling of superiority which is also correlated with dehumanization (Haslam, 2006). In addition, transferring the communication between the recruiter and the target onto a private encryption platform, for example from Facebook messenger to Whatsapp, creates an illusion of safety and security, as encryption provides anonymity to the users (Froomkin, 2017). However, this safety may be an illusion as encryption only serves the users if they are not a person of interest and targeted by the government. With a warrant, if operating in the United Kingdom, governments are able to decrypt messages through the host company used such as Apple of Facebook, as part of the enforced encryption operation programme (Temperton, 2015).
</p>

<h3>Media: MSM and Formal media</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Media plays a crucial role in IS recruitment worldwide. The two main recruitment techniques used by IS include MSM from the Western world and formal marketing (IS media). Both of these function as a psychological recruitment strategy.
</p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<h4>Western media</h4>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
The Western media can be seen as one of the Islamic State's greatest psychological recruitment weapons. Although MSM portrays the IS as a terrorist organization, focusing on the brutality of the organization and often sensationalizing the events (Faria, 2013), some argue that any exposure to IS is good exposure, as more individuals are exposed to IS ideology (Williams, 2016). The Metropolitan police stated that 50% of IS propaganda can be found in MSM newspapers and broadcasting websites (Hamilton, 2017). The IS does not generally allow foreign or state/independent journalists into their territory (with some exceptions), ensuring only their controlled propaganda gets disseminated and amplified around the world, thereby potentially increasing their support (Atwan, 2015). Many IS recruits first learn about the organization through MSM, and then actively seek out further information online through social media platforms (Berger, 2015).
</p>

<p>
	Another psychological tactic used by the IS includes claiming other un-related terrorist attacks or atrocities around the world, creating the illusion that they are more powerful than they are reality. The IS have ordered other terrorists group leaders operating within Iraq and Syria to pledge allegiance or bayat to their organization including Zawahiri (the leader of al-Qaeda) and Muller Omar (the leader of the Tailiban). This means that IS can claim responsibility for attacks by groups who have sworn allegiance (figure 7. By increasing their affiliation to other organizations, the IS is perceived as more powerful, thereby gaining more media attention (Atwan, 2015). MSM reports an incident if the IS claims responsibility for the attack. This results In more airtime and amplification of the Islamic States message (Williams, 2016).
</p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<h4>Formal media</h4>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
The IS also have their own media machine including: al-furqan, the original mouthpiece of the organization, al-Itisam, the company which creates high value videos designed for recruitment, and al-Hayat, which then disseminates these films. The group also have their own radio news station al-Bayan and a satellite television programme, Tawheed, which is broadcasts 24/7 via their online portal KalifaLive.info (Atwan, 2015). In 2007, the IS were reporting 1000 terrorist-related events per year through their media channels, this increased to 1000 per month by 2015 showing its exponential growth (McDowell-Smith, Speckhard, & Yayla, 2017).
</p>

<p>
 The IS has been reported to tailor their formal propaganda to specific countries. Each video is made to target a specific cohort of people from certain geographical locations and demographics. For example, a collection of short videos called "Muhatweets" were published by the IS featuring a German fighter speaking in German. These short videos focused on the individual's experience of the self-proclaimed caliphate and his living conditions under the regime, specifically focusing on how enjoyable the experience had been (Reuter, Salloum, & Shafy, 2014). Tailoring videos and propaganda to specific countries using the language of the nation, a national of the country to star in the video and using country-specific platforms, creates an illusion of familiarity leading to a feeling of security through trust (Zhang, Ghorbani, & Cohen, 2007). The combination of the illusion of familiarity and security, further reflects the in-out group recruitment technique as these variables increase group cohesion and out-group dehumanization through distrust (Williams, 2001) leading to a perceived association with IS operatives and a stronger sense of identification with IS ideology.
</p>

<h3>Islamophobia as a recruitment tool</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
The Western fear-based rhetoric surrounding Islam may also serve as a recruitment tool for the IS. Since the World Trade Centre terrorist attack in 2001, there has been an increase in Islamophobia both from the top-down and from a grass roots level (Abbas, 2005; Awan, 2014). In the US, the detention centre, Guantanamo bay, was opened to hold individuals suspected of terrorist-related offenses, the majority of which (if not all) are Muslim (Smith & Smith, 2007). Some groups such as the FDD, which is a neoconservative pressure group, also funded 1.2 million dollars to groups and businesses to disseminate anti-Muslim propaganda in the US to increase islamophobia. This aimed at fuelling the argument for the justification of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 (Kundnani, 2014). The election of Donald Trump in 2016 can also be argued to have been influenced by islamophobia and racist rhetoric (Huber, 2016). In the UK, police and the intelligence services have reportedly engaged in racial profiling and there are documented examples of torture against British Muslims such as Babar Ahmad (Verkaik, 2016). Correlating with the election of Donald Trump, the BREXIT (Britain existing the European Union) vote in 2016 was argued to have an underlying racist rhetoric (Virdee & McGeever, 2017), and islamophobia hate crimes have seen a fivefold increase post London bridge terror attacks in 2017 (Dodd & Marsh, 2017).
</p>
<p>
	This anti-Muslim rhetoric may create a feeling alienation for native Muslims living in Western society or Muslim immigrants/migrants and refugees (Casimiro, Hancock & Northcote, 2007). This alienation is one of the tactics used by the IS described in section two (Social media). The more extreme and frequent foreign terrorist attacks occur, the more suspicious the Western world becomes of Muslims, increasing security laws/racial profiling and further dividing societies, leading to a fertile breeding ground for home-grown terrorist activity and foreign recruits (Morgan, 2016). This feeling of alienation can lead to individuals becoming psychologically vulnerable to online recruitment (Coppock & McGovern, 2014) which can then be exploited by the IS through recruitment activity on social media platforms.
</p>

<p>
The IS employs interactive psychological techniques which operate in an interdependent nature. MSM, such as The Daily Mail, is suggested to spread fear-based, anti-Muslim rhetoric (Poynting & Mason, 2007). This may lead some Muslims to become alienated in society, resulting in the discovery of the IS through MSM, social media or the internet (google/chrome). This can then lead to the beginning of the online recruitment process through social media resulting in further isolation and extreme "them and us" (Muslims vs Western world) rhetoric. Islamophobia can also be disseminated through social media and other platforms online and is not only prevalent in MSM. Exposure to IS ideology can occur through MSM, online search engines (google/chrome) or social media. Therefore, the interaction between these three variables is not linear and may be interdependent. It may be the interaction and aggregation of these psychological techniques that makes IS effective in its recruitment strategy.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Psychological recruitment is central to the Islamic States recruitment strategy both through formal and informal recruitment techniques. It is the key variable within the terrorist organization that has made it an effective and powerful organization. The combination of psychology and effective use of technology (social media) has enabled the growth of its self-proclaimed caliphate (Atwan, 2015). There are a myriad of psychological techniques employed by the IS and although this essay does not explain and describe an exhaustive list of all current psychological recruitment techniques, it does illustrate the integral role of psychology in the targeting of potential targets to join the terrorist organization. By implementing techniques and theories such as dehumanization, in-out group theory, and alienation, and combining these with effective use of technologies, the IS has increased the power, attractiveness and effectiveness of the self-proclaimed caliphate in the digital age.

Chemical and biological weapons (CBW) can be devastating (Jansen, et al., 2014). Biological weapons (BW) are defined as living organisms that replicate inside the hosts body or can be used to target livestock and crops. BW come in four forms: viruses such as Ebola, bacteria including Anthrax, rickettsia which includes Q-fever and, finally, biological toxins such as Ricin (Cole, 2010). Some of these are contagious, spreading throughout a population quickly, and some are only dangerous to persons directly exposed (Kortepeter & Parker, 1999). Chemical weapons (CW) are man-made chemicals that are weaponized resulting in death or severe harm. They attack the nervous system and lungs and come in four categories; chocking agents which result in suffocation (chlorine gas), blistering agents such as mustard gas, blood agents such as hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B) which prevent oxygen being transported through the bloodstream, and nerve agents, such as sarin gas (SG) which attack the nervous system (Gurr & Cole, 2002).

CBW are often described as weapons of terror (WOT) (Tucker, 2000). Terror means to spread extreme fear (Sluka, 2000). When a person experiences fear, they feel out of control, which can potentially lead to irrational reactions (Öhman, 2008). The assumed purpose of CBW is to cause destruction through psychological means such as inciting confusion, uncertainty and fear (Wessely et al., 2001) and physical means such as asphyxiation or the blistering of the skin (Gurr & Cole, 2002). Due to the extreme terror experienced as a result of CBW, three international treaties/conventions exist to prohibit the use of these weapons: The Geneva protocol (1925), the biological and toxic weapons convention (1972), and the chemical weapons convention (1993). Combined these conventions prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition and use of CBW (Ilchmann & Revil, 2014). The use of CBW as WOT will be discussed below addressing issues of the symptomology and duration of the symptoms caused by CBW, personal and institutional unpreparedness, the indiscriminate and insidious nature of CBW and the public awareness surrounding the use of CBW as WOT.
Scope of the threats.

<b><h3>Biological Weapons</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Biological infectious diseases are natural phenomenon and when weaponized can be devastating (Johnson & Mueller, 2002) and cause mass anxiety in the targeted community (Kortepeter & Parker, 1999). Recent examples of the use of BW include the 2001 anthrax attack where spores were mailed to a series of government and US media offices resulting in the death of five people (Day, 2003). In 2016, Munir Mohammed and Rowaida El-Hassan were found guilty of a bomb plot in the UK and had also attempted to acquire the information to source or produce ricin. These two individuals were linked to the terrorist organization, the Islamic State (IS) (BBC, 2018).Further, in 2018, a racist letter containing a white powder which was feared to be anthrax was sent to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. Although the powder was found to be harmless, the threat was perceived to be real and the UK royal family were considered to be under attack (Jobson & Davenport, 2018).
</p>

<b><h3>Chemical weapons</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
CBW are used as weapons of war. Advances in science and technology have also enabled the weaponization of CW to become easier (Wheelis & Dando, 2003). There have been several examples of chemical attacks across the world. During WW1, gas attacks caused mass panic and terror partly due to their novelty, and were one of the most feared weapons, despite killing few people. According to Jones (2014) during one of the first reported wide-spread uses on the Western Front in 1915, 150 tones of chlorine from 6000 cylinders was released causing extreme fear. The Holocaust in Nazi Germany continues to represent the deadliest use of CW (hydrogen cyanide) in history, exterminating millions of Jews (Morocco, 2005). In 1995, members of the cult movement, Aum Shinrikyo, orchestrated a SG attack in the Tokyo subway killing 12 people (Alexander & Hoenig, 2001). Although contested by the Syrian government (Ullah & MacDonald, 2017), a more recent example is the use of CW in Syria by the Government. Since the beginning of the conflict the UN and other state-powers have accused the Syrian Government of using CW (most notably SG) on its own people (Pita & Domingo, 2014). According to the United States (US) government, 1,400 people have been killed in CW attacks in Syria since the beginning of the civil war although this number is contested (Warrick, 2013).
</p>

<b><h3>Chemical and biological weapons as weapons of mass destruction</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
CBW can be weaponized by two sets of actors; non-state actors (terrorists) or state actors (nations) (Jansen et al., 2014). There are, however, complications concerning the meaning of the word terror relating to CBW. The difference between CBW as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or WOT is argued to relate to the number of people killed and injured by the CBW. One of the most important variables in distinguishing between a WOT and a WMD, is the confinement of space. Due to the lack of ability to develop large scale CBW, terrorists are likely to deploy the CBW in a confined space to decrease dispersion and cause mass panic. For example, a SG attack on a large scale by non-state actors, such as terrorist organisations, would need 1,000 kilograms of SG to kill 10,000 people in an open air space (Alexander & Hoenig, 2001). This makes the probability of a non-state actor carrying out this type of attack very low, and therefore terrorists may be more discriminate in their attacks. In contrast, highly weaponized states are able to develop and deploy CBW as WMD causing mass casualties and fatalities due to the amount of the CBW used. Therefore, it is more likely that when terrorists use CBW it will be considered a WOT, and when states use CBW it may be considered a WMD attack (Sayed, 2015). This would assume that all CBW attacks are acts of terror as they illicit fear and panic, but, on a mass scale, more people are likely to die and therefore, the weapon becomes a WMD. Therefore, terror can be seen as a continuum and the extent of the terror felt may be dependent on the organized, pervasive and lasting nature of the attack (Fein, 2015).
</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<h2>Specific characteristics of CBW that incite terror</h2>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<b><h3>Mechanisms of action</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
CBW can illicit terror, and terror creates both acute and chronic symptoms. The immediate symptoms of CBW attacks can be extreme, causing death. For example, SG is a nerve agent and works by attacking the nervous system. When the muscles contract the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released. When the muscles stop contracting, the acetylcholine is removed and another neurotransmitter, acetylcholinesterase, is released breaking acetylcholine down to allow the muscles to relax. Sarin, attacks acetylcholinesterase, changing its structure thus making it redundant. This means that acetylcholine is not removed and therefore, the muscles can not relax. In large enough quantities, entering the blood stream through the lungs or skin, this gas will cramp the diaphragm locking the lungs in place, leading to asphyxiation (Lee, 2003).

CW can also cause prolonged destruction. The decay time of a CW depends on the type of chemical. Sarin can be lethal for 30 minutes to 24 hours after deployment. Other agents such as VX can last for up to a month. The duration of the chemical persistency depends on the environmental conditions (Hashmi & Western, 2013). The manifestation of symptoms from chemical attacks take minutes, whereas the symptoms of biological attacks can take days to manifest (Dando, 2006). Prolonged effects of gas attacks were instrumental in the perception of gas being a WOT during WW1. Some of these chronic physical symptoms include asthma, airway narrowing and chronic bronchitis (Emad & Rezaian, 1997). Both gas hysteria and gas neurosis resulted relating to the psychological aftereffects of gas attacks. Despite the low death toll as a result of gas attacks (only 4.3% of casualties from gas attacks died), CW were still one of the most feared weapons due to the extreme anxiety and psychological distress caused (Jones, 2014).
</p>

<b><h3>Personal and institutional unpreparedness</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
One of the potential variables which support the argument that CBW are WOT is their ability to catch people unaware. CBW are some of the most feared weapons, but are weapons that most societies are the unprepared for (Alexander & Hoenig, 2001). This unpreparedness such as not having the required vaccine can lead to panic both on a personal level, as well as a mass level. As an example, although the smallpox virus has been eradicated, it is reported that for every one person infected, 10-20 more people become infected with smallpox. In 1999 it was estimated that only 20% of the civilian population had any vaccination protection from this virus (Kortepeter & Parker, 1999). This is concerning as both the US and Russia were known to have stockpiles of smallpox in 2014 (Lupkin, 2014). If Russia or the US decided to use their smallpox stockpiles as a weapon, this could be devastating for the targeted population. Therefore, the unpreparedness of institutions, especially hospitals is problematic.

Hostein et al., (2014) outline four main equipment facilities needed during a CW attack: a decontamination facility, personal protective gear, access to large supplies of atropine (used to counteract the nerve agent), and a fully trained personnel team. In 2014, studies suggested that the majority of US cities were unprepared for a chemical attack. The myriad of different CW that can be used also reduces the effectiveness of the response. For example, in the attack on the city of Halabja (Iraq) in 1988, different CW were used creating a "cocktail". Mustard gas, and nerve agents such as Sarin, Tabun and VX were used, which meant that the symptoms were almost impossible to treat as each CW needed a different antidote (Alexander and Hoenig, 2001). Public knowledge that institutions do not have the necessary facilities and are not properly prepared to respond to a CW attack could lead to an increased level of fear and greater terror.
</p>

<b><h3>Ease of accessibility of information and materials</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
This fear of unpreparedness may be exacerbated by the ease of production of some CW. Hydrogen cyanide and Tabun are reportedly easy to produce and do not require any large-scale production facilities (Gurr & Cole, 2002). Further, through the internet, information on how to produce CBW is easy to obtain (Conway, 2006). For example, the Terrorist's handbook or the Anarchists cookbook both detail how to make a CW (Weimann, 2016). Journal articles on open source web sites such as Acta Scandinavia and Merck Index supply all the information needed to produce a CBW (Gurr & Cole, 2002).

It is also possible to obtain chemical/biological substances which can be weaponized through the internet (Kortepeter & Parker, 1999). For example, the Zika virus can be bought online. Although only for medical use, with fake documentation and forged credentials from the dark web, suspicious persons may be able to access these chemical/biological substances. Toxic substances can also be obtained illegally though the dark net. In 2015, a 16-year old boy ordered Abrin (30 times more toxic than Ricin) on a dark net website (Weimann, 2016). This ease of accessibility may have increased the public's fear relating to CBW and substances.
The indiscriminate nature of CBW

There are some instances where targeted BW have been used on specific individuals and are therefore used as a discriminate weapon. For example, the assassination of Hungarian dissident Georgi Markov in London in 1978 was conducted using Ricin. However, CBW are more often used as indiscriminate weapons. Once the CBW has been released, it can spread through a myriad of ways (Price, 1997). The indiscriminate nature of CBW can decimate a population. It is estimated that in a 300km2 radius, the deployment of anthrax spores would kill between 1,000,000-3,00,000 people on a clear, calm night (Dando, 2006). . In March 2018, there was a nerve agent attack in the UK (Salisbury) in an 'attempt to assassinate' a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal (Ma & Corcoran, 2018). The nerve agent used was the Russian-made Novichok and has been reported to potentially have infected 38 people maybe hundreds. Although it was a targeted attack, because of the difficulty in containing the agent, more people may have been affected (Dearden & Sharman, 2018). Further, during the Vietnam war (1961-1971), the US used the CW agent orange (AO), on the Vietnamese population. The estimation is that at least 2.1 million to 4.8 million people may have been present during the spraying (Stellman et al., 2003). The toxin dioxin contaminant, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxine causes extreme physical effects such as physical and intergenerational deformities (Ngo et al., 2006), and cancer (Park & Kim, 1994). The contamination of the soil whereby the Vietnamese people sourced their food, led to further contamination and greater terror (Schecter et al., 1995). Therefore, the effects of AO may prove detrimental to future generations and the wider populace not directly sprayed during the war.
</p>

<b><h3>The insidious nature of CBW</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
CBW are insidious. Some agents, such as SG cannot be seen or smelt (Alexander & Hoenig, 2001). There is little or no warning for CBW attacks (Croddy, 2002). In order to be afraid, the targeted population need to be aware of the attack. When the targeted population learn of the attack through the media or other forms of information dissemination, this can increase the level of fear experienced by a population ensuring that not only is terror activated during the event through mass panic (Kortepeter & Parker, 1999), but fear is present in the aftermath as people may fear that they have been exposed to the agent if they were in the vicinity of the attack (Alexander & Hoenig, 2001). This delay in receiving vital information about the attack may lead to people claiming to be sick when they are not out of fear and panic (Jones, 2014). Further, the perpetrators for CW attacks are also unlikely to be present while the attack occurs making the attack seem even more indiscriminate and frightening due to the nameless, faceless and uncontrollable nature of the attack (Croddy, 2002).
</p>

<b><h3>The influence of the media in spreading fear</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Public perception of CBW may increase the amount of terror associated with CBW. During the 1990's there was an increase in public information relating to CBW. There was a larger focus on CBW in the news and in the mainstream media through films and books. This increased focus on CBW may have been related to the fall of the SU as after the fall of the SU there were government scientists that specialised in CBW who were unemployed. This led to some SU scientists selling their expertise of CBW to the highest bidder, which were often anti-American terrorist groups and nations (Gurr & Cole, 2002). Because of this, the US government perceived itself and the country to be under threat from CBW. The US army and the intelligence agencies were also competing for funding to build more biolabs, drawing attention to the vulnerabilities of the US counter-CBW strategy, which further highlighted the urgency of the threat (Gurr & Cole, 2002). This fear led to the creation of a new form of terrorism coined 'super terrorism' by the US government (Cole, 2010).

In response to this "super terrorism" threat, the US government employed apocalyptic scenarios to create their anti-CBW strategy, which was mainly disseminated through the media. The sensationalization of news, and the continued focus on the worse-case scenario led to a series of alarmist narratives concerning CBW (Gurr & Cole, 2002). At this time, books about CBW became best-sellers reaching a wider audience. For example, The Cobra event written in 1997, is a book about the creation of a genetically modified BW used to attack the US. This book reportedly led President Clinton to fund more research into bioterrorism (Gurr & Cole, 2002). During this period, the film industry increased funding for spy films such as Mission Impossible 2, which focused on terrorist use of CBW (Gurr & Cole, 2002). A more recent example of CBW in the media can be seen in 2015. A popular counter-terrorism television programme, Homeland, portrayed a major terrorist threat in the form of a SG attack in Berlin carried out by the Islamic State (IS) (a terrorist organization). In the series, before the major indiscriminate attack was carried out in the Berlin subway (reminiscent of the Tokyo SG attack), one of the protagonists was locked in a cage and gassed with the chemical, Sarin (Birnbaum, 2015). This event, which was filmed, lasting 1.40 minutes (repeated three times) showed the detailed effects of SG on the human body. This worldwide broadcast of a fictional CW attack may have incited fear in viewers who may have perceived the use of CW to be imminent and probable. Further, the attack was based on a real terrorist organization, the IS, who potentially had the capabilities to carry out such a sophisticated, wide-spread chemical attack on the West, as they have previously used mustard, chlorine and phosphine gas in Syria and Iraq (Strack, 2017). This highlights the probability an actual attack. Finally, as mentioned President Clinton was inspired by The Cobra Event, President Obama stated that Homeland was his favourite television programme (Huffington Post, 2012). This positive endorsement by both presidents may have attracted a larger audience thus making people more aware of the potential for a chemical attack.

As discussed, it is thus probable that more people will become fearful of CBW if they are exposed through the media to narratives surrounding such attacks, as they may think these types of weapons and attacks are more prevalent and imminent then they are. Therefore, although CBW are WOT, the extent of the terror experienced may depend on the rhetoric regarding these weapons, communicated through media and entertainment mediums. It could be argued that people only become scared when they become aware of something fearful. Therefore, increasing the airtime and fear-rhetoric associated with CBW through the media, government and popular media may have increased the public fear associated with CBW.
</p>

<b><h3>Conclusion</h3></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
CBW are WOT. They elicit fear and panic in populations exposed and can leave populations devastated. The effects can be immediate and/or chronic. They can cause direct physical and/or psychological harm or death, can destroy agriculture and can have damaging effects at a cross-generational level. The use of CBW elicit a sense of terror because of the unpreparedness of the population and institutions, and the indiscriminate and insidious nature of the agent being used. The perceived terror associated with CBW may be affected by exposure to news reports, entertainment mediums, and knowledge of the agent/attack. It is also likely that when a CBW is used as a WMD it has been used by a nation state resulting in widespread death and destruction. When a non-state organization, such as a terrorist group, uses a CBW, it is used as a WOT because of the method of deployment, feasibility and level of destruction caused.  Therefore, CBW are always WOT, although the level of terror can be variable depending on the scale of the attack.

  <h1>Why is the rape of women so common in wars and civil disturbance?</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Rape has long been used as a weapon of war (WOW) and civil disturbance (Gottschall, 2004) and is often used as a systematic WOW against the enemy civilian population (Gottschall, 2004). Rape can be defined as "the penetration of the anus or vagina with any object or body part or of any body part of the victim or perpetrator's body with a sexual organ, by force or by threat of force or coercion, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment, or against a person incapable of giving genuine consent" (Wood, 2009, p. 133).This essay will focus on the rape of women. Brownmiller (1975) argues that rape is not only a complex attack against women by men, but it is also an attack on the male enemy. This adds a multi-layered, multi-faceted element to the concept of the rape of women, making it a more complex act. There are many different reasons why rape is used so prevalently as a WOW. This essay will discuss the main reasons by utilizing Clark's (2017) five factor model. This model focuses on opportunism, entitlement, revenge, humiliation and the reinforcement of group cohesion. It argues that these five factors need to be addressed in order to understand the use of rape as a WOW. In addition to these five factors, the use of strategic rape in its most extreme form as an instrument of ethnic cleansing (EC) will also be discussed. Before addressing the issue of rape during war time, it is also relevant to address attitudes and legislation regarding rape and women during peace-time, and explore how these may influence the use of rape during times of war and civil disturbance.
Attitudes and legislation relating to rape and women during peace time
</p>
There are two main factors relating to rape during times of war; the macro and micro environment. The macro scale, focuses on the socio-cultural variables that may underpin the sexual violence perpetrated during war, and the micro scale addresses the particular reasons for rape being used in certain conflicts. It is argued that certain cultural and societal norms, such as the perceived inferiority of women, are associated with an increase in rape, and these norms can be reinforced through legislation or a lack of legislation (Clark & Lewis, 1977). The cultural perception of women in society is also related to the incidences of rape. In Nigeria, for examples, these cultural practices include forced marriage, female genital mutilation, widowhood practices (such as not allowing a widow to leave the house) (Ifemeje, 2012) as well as strictly defined gender roles which reinforce women as inferior (Zenn & Pearson, 2014). The man holds total sexual power over the wife, and is legally allowed to sexually and physically abuse her, when not obeyed (Ifemeje, 2012). It is argued that these cultural practices also influence the use of rape by Boko Haram (the terrorist organisation operating in Nigeria), one main tactic of which includes rape (Zenn & Pearson, 2014).
</p>

<p>
Legislation may also play an integral role in the treatment and perception of women in peace-time society. Some of the highest statistics (from charities and non-governmental organizations) of rape during peace-time come from countries that do not have coherent legislation in place to protect women from rape (Rape Crisis, 2018). Research has shown how patriarchal practices in South African society relate to violence against women (Mookodi, 1999; Maundeni, 2001). For example, during the apartheid in South Africa, rape was seen as permissible when perpetrated by young men. This is because there was a belief that lack of sex in young men leads to mental health problems (Armstrong, 1994). This meant that during the apartheid, many rapes went unreported or unprosecuted, as the authorities turned a blind eye to them. In Nigeria, the legislation is also discriminatory against women. Within section 55 of Nigerian Law, there is implied legal backing relating to the abuse and assault of women by their husbands. According to section 6 of the criminal code, marital rape is not acknowledged as a crime. Therefore, discriminatory legislation or lack of cohesive legislation in society may encourage more men to rape women as they are unlikely to be prosecuted for their acts (Zenn & Pearson, 2014).
</p>

<p>
Even in peaceful societies that have a strong legal system and adhere to the rule of law, such as the UK (United Kingdom), rape is still prevalent. UK official statistics estimate that over 35,699 people were raped in 2016 (Carr, 2017). In 2016/2017, reports in the UK show that only 15% of rape victims report rape or sexual abuse and only a very small number of these cases result in a conviction (Rape Crisis, 2018). This highlights the difficulty of addressing the issue of rape even in a society that has specific laws in place to protect the victims of rape. The concept of male ownership of women in peace-time, may also influence the use of rape during conflict or war. Historically, in the UK before the 19th century, when a man and a woman married, the woman would become the property of the man and thus adopted her husband's surname. Even in 2002 it was estimated that in the US only 3% of children bear their mothers surname, while 97% adopt their fathers surname (Johnson & Scheuble, 2002). This suggests that even Western societies have an implicit inferiority rhetoric rooted in ownership laws and traditions relating to women. Boesten (2010) argues 'we can only combat rape in war if the gendered nature of warfare is addressed, and we can only address the gendered nature of war if we recognize its roots in peacetime inequalities and practices' (p. 128).
Understanding the socio-cultural make-up of a particular society is therefore important in understanding the macro causes of rape, and this macro background can underpin the micro use of rape in specific war time or conflict scenarios (Clarke, 2017).
</p>
<h3>The widespread use of rape during war</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Rape is extensively used as a WOW, and some argue that the absence of wide-spread rape during war or conflict seems to be a rare phenomenon (Wood, 2009). One female survivor of the Cote d'Ivoire civil war (2002-2007) stated "there's so much rape, it's normal; we don't even talk about it' (Farr, 2009, p. 18). Figure 1 shows instances of rape in various war or conflict scenarios. Although the reported figures are high, it is estimated that only 7% of survivors of rape in conflict contexts report the crime, suggesting that the actual numbers are likely to be much higher than reported . This reflects the wide-scale, systematic use of rape during war (Wolfe, 2015). Rape is also normally used by both or all sides of a conflict as a WOW, it is not a specific tactic of a single military, so this further explains its widespread impact (Clarke, 2017).
Clarke's model was based on a series of interviews with 66 women and 13 men after the Bosnian war between the years 1992-1995. Based on interview data collected, Clarke established a five-factor model focusing on the five micro causal factors which need to be explored in order to understand why rape is used as a WOW (Clarke, 2017). These factors are discussed below.
</p>

<h3>Opportunism</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
The first of Clarke's (2016) factors is opportunism. Opportunistic rape is considered one of the most widespread forms of rape used during war. This type of rape is often indiscriminate and occurs in villages on the 'battlefield' (Farr, 2009). During war and conflict, the social fabric of society breaks down. The legal system is interrupted and the social laws and norms no longer apply. This allows extreme levels of opportunistic behaviour to take place, including the rape of women, which may normally be prohibited by both laws and social rules (Farr, 2009). Mullins states in relation to the war in Rwanda that 'opportunistic rapes were those that were a product of the widespread chaos and disorganization of the on-going genocide, as they were seemingly neither controlled nor organized' (2009, p. 726). Further, if the conviction rate is so low in societies that have legislation in place to protect women from rape during peace-time, as stated above, then it can be assumed that the conviction rate is even lower in countries currently at war or experiencing civil disturbance where the rule of law may be interrupted (Gavin, 2015). For example, in 2008, the Rwandan tribunal heard the cases of 48 men who were accused of rape and sexual violence charges during the Rwandan genocide. Out of these 48 men, 15 went to trial, and only five were convicted. These charges were then dropped as part of an exchange to attain information from the perpetrators about other crimes committed during the war (Buss, 2009). The low likelihood of conviction may lead to more women not reporting the abuse they endure, furthering the incentive for men to use rape as a WOW. Men/soldiers may also exploit this lack of cohesive legislation and the break-down of the social fabric of society to fulfil their own desire. As one soldier from the DRC says 'maybe I have a bandit's thought. . . . I see a woman passing by, and I begin to desire her, then I come and I jump into her phoof' (Kelly, 2010, p. 8).
</p>

<p>
Although rape has long been used as a WOW, the legislation prohibiting rape during war has been vague and open to interpretation. The specifics of language is key when considering the prohibition of rape during war. Because of the specifics of language, rape may have been considered to be permissible during WW1 and WW2. The 1929 Geneva convention, states that 'women [prisoners of war] shall be treated with all consideration due to their sex' (Gaggioli, 2014, p. 512). This does not explicitly prohibit the use of rape during war. The third Geneva convention used the same language as the 1929 convention thus leaving the law open to interpretation. In contrast, the 1949 fourth Geneva Convention focuses on the increased danger towards women in conflict zones outlining that women shall be protected from rape or any form of indecent assault (ICRC, 2018). Further, the Additional Protocol in 1977 states that "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault", are "prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or by military agents (Gaggioli, 2014, p. 512). An additional provision of the Additional Protocol (1977) further protected women during war 'against rape, enforced prostitution and any other form of indecent assault' (Gaggioli, 2014, p. 512). In 1998 the former Yugoslavian and Rwandan International Criminal Tribunal first ruled that rape was a crime against humanity (United Nations, 2018). Finally, in 2008, the UN passed a unanimous resolution 1820 specifying that rape is a tactic of war, not merely a side effect of war as the previous laws had suggested (United Nations, 2018). Historically, therefore, the lack of specific legislation and language regarding systematic rape as a WOW may have given both soldiers and generals perceived permission to sexually abuse women who were considered the enemy during times of war.
</p>

<h3>Entitlement</h3>
<p>
The second factor in Clarke's model is entitlement. Entitlement is the assumption that one has the right to something. One of the things that some soldiers believe they have the right to is women. In some conflicts, such as the conflict in Sierra Leone, rape was considered a man's right and part of a soldiers due (Kelly, 2010). Some soldiers believe they own the women they invade, capture or free. Ownership can be explicit through legislation or implicit, through social attitudes towards women. For example, during the Peruvian war, women were often captured and given as gifts to foot soldiers. This act of trading or giving abducted women to other soldiers and members of the population was also present in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) conflict (Kelly, 2010). This act of sexual violence is called 'war booty' and is widespread in conflicts and wars (Boesten, 2010).
The assumption that you are entitled to something correlates with the idea of ownership (Dixon, 2015) If women are perceived to be owned by men, the rape of women during times of war can also be perceived as an assault on other men. The primary victim in this situation is the woman, but the act may be driven by other motivations. If women are considered property during war, then by raping a woman, her wealth is devalued because she is perceived as dirty and damaged, and this is argued to devalue the wealth of their fathers, brothers or husbands (Bataille, 1993). She is thus "a precious object [that] is turned into an abject" (Zakuan et al., 2006, p. 117). The concept of abjection is multi-layered and based on the feminist theory by Kristeva (Kristeva, 1982). On the individual level, to be abject means that the person perceives themselves as morally inferior and dirty. On a communal level, they are ostracized by society because victims of rape are sometimes perceived to be alien, disgusting and outside the boundaries of normality (Diken & Laustsen, 2005).
</p>

<h3>Revenge</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Clark (2017) states that there are three types of revenge relating to rape during war. The first is personal rape, the second is mirroring-revenge, and the third is event-triggered revenge. Personal rape includes the individual being raped as punishment for something they themselves have done. An example of rape used as a form of punishment is seen in Nigeria by Boko Haram. Sexual "jizya" is stated to be a tax owed by women if they are Christian under Islamic Law. This tax can be repaid through the repeated rape of a Christian woman. This type of rape is a form of punishment by Boko Haram for not being Muslim (Zenn & Pearson, 2014) and is therefore a form of personal rape. Mirroring-revenge rape is the perception that the soldiers of one side are only doing what the enemy would do and are therefore mirroring the predicted behaviour of the enemy. An example of this comes from the Bosnian war where a Serb interviewee raped by six men says: 'she pleaded with the first soldier to stop, but he told her that he was only doing what the 'Četniks' were doing' (Clarke, 2017, p. 396). Clarke argues that mirror-revenge rape is much more common during times of war than personal rape. Finally, event-triggered rape has been used to avenge war-related losses and is therefore an act committed in reaction to some unrelated event during the war. For example, at the end of WW2, the red army (Soviet Union) sexually violated and raped thousands of German women while marching through Nazi Germany. This mass rape was seen as an instrument of revenge and "pay-back" for crimes committed against the Soviet Union by the Third Reich (Zenn & Pearson, 2014). According to Clarke (2017), event-triggered rape is also very widespread during war.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the three reasons men rape for revenge during times of war outlined by Clark, in some societies, women also fear being punished for a second time for revealing their previous inflicted abuse in times of war. It is common in some cultures that the incidence of rape is thought to bring shame on the family and is perceived as the woman's fault. Women are thus punished for the event and are often abandoned by their husbands if they have been a victim of rape (Schabel & Tabyshalieva, 2012). Many women interviewed by Human Rights organizations report that they do not tell their husbands that they have been raped for fear that their husbands will reject them, and some women even fear being killed (Stigelmayer, 1994; Salzman, 1998). In some societies, women who have been raped in certain societies during war are then seen as abject and are unable to get married because they are perceived as dirty and impure (Fisher, 1996). They are considered unworthy of marriage because of the shame and dishonor they will bring to the man (Schabel & Tabyshalieva, 2012). This leads to the further humiliation of the woman both during and after the act of rape as they may then be ostracized by society (Brownmiller, 2013). Therefore, an additional  reason to rape a woman during war may not only be for primary revenge but also for secondary revenge, where the women is punished for the second time by their own society. This makes rape an even more effective tool of war.
</p>

<h3>To humiliate</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
The third factor that Clarke highlights is the use of rape in war time scenarios to humiliate. Rape is an adaptable instrument and can exploit many complex societal and gender-specific issues. On an individual level, rape as a form of humiliation degrades the woman and attacks her sense of self-worth. Her self-perception is permanently changed by this act and can leave psychological as well as physical scars. Many victims of war time rape maintained that 'they are no longer the same person that they were before they were raped'  (Clarke, 2017, p. 399).
</p>

<p>
Some academics suggest that the rape of enemy women is a sign of total conquest and victory (Goldstein, 2001). It can be seen as a humiliating act for the defeated nation and the men who failed to protect the women of their country. In some cases, the rape of the women of the enemy nation is referred to as a metaphorical castrating act and aims to highlight the impotence and helplessness of the defeated enemy (Brownmiller, 2013). Rape as a weapon to humiliate is therefore reported to be used to humiliate the men, even though the women are the primary victims of the attack. It suggests that the men have failed to protect 'their' women and are powerless to do anything (Bergoffen, 2009).
</p>

<h3>Group cohesion</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Group cohesion is the fourth factor of Clarke's model. Soldiers in all nations are taught to dehumanize the enemy. Without this, they would be ineffective soldiers and not be able to carry out their duty. The military is known for its misogynistic rhetoric and use of dehumanization tactics. For example, one common chant in the US military is "this is my rifle; this is my gun [hand on crotch] this is for fighting, this is for fun" (Wood, 2009, p. 138). US Soldiers are also referred to as "ladies" as a derogatory term to increase group cohesion through humour. This cohesive chanting and insulting each other creates a 'special bond' between the comrades thereby improving group cohesion of soldiers (Siebold, 2007). This combination of dehumanizing the enemy and the expression of misogynistic attitudes towards women, may lead to more soldiers raping women during war.
</p>

<p>
Rape has also been used as a form of initiation into the military. Serb soldiers, most notably the White Eagles, were reportedly forced to rape during the Bosnian conflict as a form of initiation to increase group morale and bonding (Zakuan et al., 2006). Gang rape is considered an effective method to bond soldiers through group-loyalty and trust. This also makes it unlikely that any of the perpetrators will admit to their crimes out of peer pressure (Boesten, 2010). This act then establishes group cohesion through the in-group out-group theory. The in-group out-group theory outlines that being part of an in-group increases feelings of belonging and the perception that you are special, which further reinforces group connection (Diken & Lausten, 2005). During the act of rape during war, the men (soldiers) who are engaging in the act of rape are the in-group, and the women represent the out-group (Milillo, 2006). This bonding can be increased through a collective brotherhood of guilt.
Not all soldiers collude with this use of rape in conflict scenarios. In some cases, Serb soldiers who refused to take part in the rape of Bosnian women were publically humiliated to make an example of, and in extreme cases either castrated or killed (Zakuan et al., 2006). It is argued that an individual soldier who is prepared to sacrifice his own conscience for the good of group-cohesion exemplifies his uncompromising loyalty and purpose to the group (Morrow, 1993) thus making him more obedient and conformist to the group majority behaviours and attitudes (Gal, 1985; Milgram & Gudehus, 1978; Boesten, 2010). Therefore, rape can be used as a tactic to increase group cohesion among soldiers through degrading women, and by establishing an in-group/out-group mentality, where trust and loyalty among the in-group are reinforced through the act of rape.
</p>

<p>
In addition to building binds among soldiers, rape can also break down group cohesion in the targeted families and societies. During conflicts, there have been reported cases of family members and other members of society having to watch the act of rape take place. This destroys group cohesion by humiliating the woman being raped and humiliating the men of society in a metaphorical castration (Salzman, 1998; Askin, 1997). Using rape publically can also instill a sense of terror into the community, further spreading anxiety and distrust (Buss, 2009). This can be an effective way to break down group cohesion in the enemy population, as the trauma of the rape is experienced not only by the woman being raped, but by the extended family or community. In this way a larger number of people are affected. The guilt and trauma associated with this  enforced act of watching can be extreme and destructive (Diken & Lausten, 2005).
</p>

<p>
Group cohesion can also be affected by bearing children of rape. In some cases, the child of the raped women are abandoned. This is quite common during war (Kozaric-Kovacic et al., 1995). However, if the victim bears a child, the child may be seen by the women as abject. The woman may continue to feel polluted by the child and the memory of the event (Zakuan et al., 2006). In the aftermath of the fall of Yugoslavia, women of Catholic and Muslim faith who bore children as a result of being raped were reported to refer to those children as "filth" or "that thing" which illustrates their detachment from the child (Salzman, 1998, p. 365). This detachment from the mother to the child is a strategic weapon of the enemy. Family bonds between the child and their mother become more difficult and are riddled with guilt and mistrust. This breakdown of the mother/child bond further divides society and diminishes group-cohesion (Kristeva, 1982). As argued above, women will often be abandoned by their husbands after they have been raped during conflict, therefore, the women and children may be even more vulnerable as they may be perceived as bearing the enemy's offspring and thus may become a target of violence (Christian et al., 2011). This further splinters their society as the woman and child (and anyone who protects them) may be perceived to be the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The act of rape can cause long-term psychological symptoms after the event further dividing society. Out of a study consisting of 25 Bosnian and Croatian women that had been raped in the Bosnian war, four had attempted suicide and 13 were reported as having depression (Kozaric-Kovacic et al., 1995). It is estimated that in the aftermath of the Second Congo war in the DRC, 76% of sexual violence victims (almost always involving rape) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, 68% from depression and 33% had attempted suicide (Johnson et al., 2010). The act of rape may also decrease the individual's self-esteem, sense of self-worth and may increase her sense of helplessness and hopelessness, potentially making it more difficult for the woman to engage positively with  society.
</p>

<p>
Group cohesion is imperative to the rebuilding of a society after conflict has occurred. With group cohesion, trust can be ensured, and the community can work together to rebuild what has been lost both physically and psychologically. Without group cohesion and trust, psychological bridges cannot be reconnected within the community and thus the community continues to be splintered and ruled by distrust and fear. Group cohesion is therefore imperative to rebuild the community after the devastation of war. If rape divides societies and breaks down group cohesion, it can be highly effective as a short-term, non-strategic instrument of war. However, if the aim is to conquer the society invaded, then once the war ends and victory has been won, group cohesion of the enemy population is key to rebuilding the society to make it an effective civilization again (Kelly, 2010). By using rape as a WOW, this group cohesion is eroded, thereby making the rebuilding of society to be more difficult. Therefore, though highly effective in breaking down societal bonds in the short term, as a long-term strategy, rape can be argued to be an ineffective weapon, which may severely hinder the rebuilding of the society after the conflict has ended.
</p>

<h3>Ethnic cleansing</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
In addition to the underpinning nature of social norms and the five categories outlined above, it can also be argued that there is another important variable that contributes to the likelihood of rape being used as a WOW. Rape in its most extreme form can be used as an  effective instrument of EC (Zakuan et al., 2006). EC is described as forcibly eradicating or diluting certain ethnic groups (Salzman, 1998).
In times of conflict, some soldiers are encouraged to forcibly, deliberately impregnate women. Through strategic rape, the mother's genes are diluted with the enemy's genes through the birth of a child. In 2014, 234 women were freed by the Nigerian security forces from the terrorist organization, Boko Haram and 214 of these women (91%) were reported to be pregnant when released (Gavin, 2015). The forced impregnation of these women means that the mother's blood line is diluted and this is therefore a type of EC. Deliberate impregnation also occurred in rape camps during the Bosnian war (Sofos, 1996). One of the reasons sexual camps were used (where women would become pregnant as a result of rape) during the Bosnian war was because in the Balkans, the child inherits the family name of the father irrespective of his ethnicity or religion. Therefore, although the child would genetically be half Serb, half Albanian, the child would be considered Albanian if the rapist was Albanian, thus further eradicating the family history of the mother (Sofos, 1996). Because of this tradition in the Balkans, women were sometimes considered mere incubators for men to impregnate and continue their family name (Salzman, 1998), thereby reinforcing the concept of women as inferior and property. By impregnating a Bosnian Muslim woman, the soldiers intended to make the mothers hate and destroy their own children (Slapsak, 2000). Some children born of rape are abandoned and some are even killed (Carpenter, 2000) thus leading to further EC. This shares similarities to viewing the child as abject and therefore breaks down group cohesion, which can lead to a cultural EC as well as physical EC through the dissipation of peoples.
</p>

<p>
As argued above, women who experience rape as a WOW are often psychologically and physically traumatized. This can lead them to not have any future children because of the psychological trauma, or become infertile because of the physical trauma they have endured (Bataille, 1993). Women may miscarry and may end up being infertile because of the extent of damage from the rape. Gang rape can also lead to a higher incidence of pain and injury and may result in death (Clifford & Slavery, 2008). Many women who become pregnant with the offspring of the rapist may also attempt to have an unsterile abortion, which can lead to severe consequences for the mother and the baby including death (Clifford & Slavery, 2008).
</p>

<p>
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which weakens the immune system and can have serious detrimental consequences for the women and may lead to infertility, is a serious concern regarding rape victims. Infection with HIV, during times of conflict, is often used as a weapon to cause as much devastation to the enemy as possible (Hankins et al., 2002). In 1995, Rwanda's heath minister stated 'during the war, captured women were deliberately taken to HIV positive soldiers to be raped' (Dodd, 1995, p. 1). It is impossible to know how many people contract HIV/AIDS during times of conflict as it is not known how many people were infected before the war or civil disturbance. However, uncertainty analysis suggests that mass rape, for example in the DRC, could lead to 10,000 women/girls being infected with HIV annually (0.01% of the population) (Virginie et al., 2010). If the rape results in a pregnancy, HIV is not only a danger to the mother but also the unborn child. HIV is a transmittable disease and may be passed on from parent to child during pregnancy or while breastfeeding (Paiva et al., 2003). It is estimated that 25% of babies will contract HIV if their mothers have untreated HIV (American Pregnancy Association, 2017). All the above side effects of rape can lead to EC. The woman who has been raped may die herself or become infertile due to the damage caused by the rape. She may contract the HIV virus and pass this on to her children. In addition, where a woman bears a child as a result of rape, the mixing of the woman's genes with those of the rapist can lead to a perceived strengthening of the genetic legacy of the attacking community.
</p>

<h3>The interaction of variables influencing rape used as a WOW</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Although the above six variables leading to rape during war can be segregated, they are not mutually exclusive and often interact with each other. This may both increase the likelihood that rape will occur, and allow those who rape to feel justified in their actions. The interaction of the micro and macro variables are key, along with the interactive nature of the 6 factors discussed above that can lead to rape during war (Figure 2 and 3).
</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Rape is prevalent as a WOW during most wars. Due to the break-down of laws and social norms of society during conflict and war, the specific figures relating to rape during war/conflict are difficult to know or predict. However, statistics show that rape is more likely to be used than not during times of war, often by both/all sides of the conflict. Research also suggests that rape is not a side effect of war, as was previously assumed, but in most cases it is used in a systematic way as an instrument of war itself. There are different reasons as to why rape is used as a WOW and is so prevalent in war and conflicts across the world. The main reason is because of its multi-faceted, complicated nature. The macro environment is likely to have an effect on the micro environment. If women are degraded and perceived as inferior to men during peace-time, this is likely to influence the perception of women during war time, which in turn is likely to lead to more sexual atrocities against women taking place in times of conflict. On a micro scale, Clarke (2017) outlines five variables believed to be the main reasons for rape being used as a WOW. These are opportunism, entitlement, revenge, humiliation and group dynamics/cohesion. Additionally, rape can be used as a strategic weapon of EC by diluting the gene pool of a certain people. Rape may lead to enemy women becoming pregnant and bearing the children of the man/men that raped them. Rape may also lead to women not wanting to bear children because of the physical and psychological trauma of the rape, or may be unable to bear children as a consequence of the rape. Rape as a WOW causes immense destruction on an individual/societal scale and can cause devastating physical and psychological pain. It not only breaks down social bonds and trust but also ensures that the rebuilding of society is difficult and painful. Rape, therefore is used as a WOW because of the complex nature of rape and the multi-layered destruction it leaves behind.

  <h1>Are there any general characteristics of the Kamikaze attacks that might apply to the current terrorist threat?</h1>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <p>
World War Two (WW2) was a war from 1939-1945 that involved the greatest powers of the world and caused global devastation. This war comprised of two primary sides: The Axis, Nazi Germany, Japan and Italy and the Allies, the United Kingdom (UK), United States (US) and France (Gilbert, 1989). From October 1944-August 1945, in a desperate attempt to expel the American invading fleet, the Japanese engaged in a mission named Kamikaze (divine wind/God wind) (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2018) which was designed to cause as much damage to the allied forces as possible. Between these dates, just under 4000 Japanese pilots deliberately crashed their aircrafts, Ohka (rocket powered bomb piloted by one man), submarines, motorboats or frogman mines (underwater mines held by humans) into allied ships with no hope or expectation of survival (Zagola, 2011).
</p>

<p>
  Just as WW2 was the most serious threat in 1939 (Churchill, 2002), international terrorism is considered by most governments and the United Nations (UN) to be one of the current biggest threats to national security and international stability (Pool Re, 2016; United Nations, 2016). The current terrorist threat remains high in most Western countries (Turak, 2017) and in areas such as Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Nigeria shown in figure 1 (Esri, 2018). This threat is also likely to increase during 2018 (Turak, 2017). The US department of defense defines terrorism as 'the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological objectives' (Hoffman, 2006, p 31). There are numerous terrorist organizations across the world from many faiths and political ideologies, for example Hezbollah (Lebanon), PKK (Turkey), Al-Qaeda (Middle East, Somalia and Yemen), Tamil Tigers (Sri Lanka), and National Action (UK) (Schweitzer, 2000). Although many of these terrorist organizations pose a threat to international stability, from 2014-2017, many international organizations and nations report that the Islamic State (IS) was the most serious international terrorist threat (Friedman, 2017). Recently, the IS has been losing power and ground. In 2018, the IS killed 21 fewer people per day in 2018 compared to 2016 (Figure 2). However, despite this, the IS is still currently one of the most serious international terrorist threats (Smith & Neubert, 2017), and therefore, the IS will be the focus of terrorist activity in this essay.
</p>

<p>
The complex political, socio-cultural, religious, and historical variables which may have influenced the kamikaze attacks (KA) and the current use of suicide missions (SM) by the IS are different (Orbell & Morikawa, 2011). However, although these two missions are not the same, there are some general characteristics that are shared. This essay will discuss the key similarities between KA and IS SM, by focusing on four themes: the nature of SM, group values and tradition, obedience to a higher authority and peer pressure.
</p>


<h3>Suicide missions</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Suicide as an outcome was the most obvious characteristic of this form of mission during the KA. Pilots understood that they were giving up their lives for their country, by flying their aircraft into enemy ships (Smiyh, 2014). Neither the individual executing the attack nor the orchestrator of the attack expected the individual involved to survive the mission (Ganor, 2000). This shares similarities with the current threat from the IS currently operating in Syria and Iraq (BBC, 2017). One of the signature tactics of the IS is the use of SM. People are used as bombs to blow themselves up in a crowd and vehicles are driven into buildings/crowds and are exploded (Dearden, 2017). After the Paris suicide bombings (November 2015), some newspapers such as The Times and Japan Today, referred to the attacks as KA (Spencer, 2017). Japan Today (2015) stated 'three brothers may have been part of the eight-strong IS kamikaze terror squad'. Some contest the use of the word Kamikaze to describe these kinds of attacks arguing that 'the Kamikaze did what they did to protect the country, terrorism is the meaningless targeting of civilians' (Japan Today, 2015, p 1).
</p>

<p>
 However, others argue that most of the IS targets are legitimate and discriminate targets, such as military bases (Grierson, 2017), thereby potentially sharing motivational similarities with the KA. A study by Grierson (2017) in 2015/2016 of 1000 SM carried out by the IS shows that 84% of these SM were directed at military targets often attempting to slow down the opposition. 70% of these IS SM were carried out using vehicles such as hummers, tankers, cars, and lorries (Grierson, 2017). The tactic of these SM was for the protagonist to ram a vehicle into a military/civilian target and blow themselves up with the target. The IS SM are therefore mostly strategic in their approach rather than individual and sporadic (Grierson, 2017). This use of people and vehicles to attack a defined target reflects similarities with the KA. The  KA were used to target allied ships/boats to damage America's fleet. The use of vehicles by the IS is similar to the use of planes, submarines, motorboats or Ohka used in the KA. In both scenarios the protagonist expects to die.
</p>

<p>
The use of SM is an obvious connection between the kamikaze and the IS. However, the motivational reasoning behind the IS uses of SM as well as their operational use may also share similarities with the KA. The similarities in the motivation of the kamikaze pilots and the IS SM actors will be discussed below using Rielly's (2010) Three Factor model.
</p>

<h3>The Three factor model</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Rielly developed the Three Factor model (2010) which outlines three main factors that influenced Japanese soldiers to carry out a SM as part of the KA. These factors are: group values and tradition, obedience to the Emperor (higher authority) and peer pressure. These factors are explored below in relation to both KA in WW2 and recent terrorist activity by IS.
</p>

<h3>Group values and tradition</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Religion may have been a motivator for some kamikaze pilots. Japanese society is based on two religions; Buddhism and Shintō (Gambetta, 2005). Most Japanese individuals reportedly follow both religions (Prideaux, 2007). Shintō is looked to for instruction on fertility, birth and marriage. Buddhism is looked to for understanding and guidance pertaining to the afterlife (Gambetta, 2005). In the Shintō religion, it is believed that the spirits of the deceased would join the kami (divinities) as ancestral spirits protecting the future generations of Japan. These ancestral spirits held God-like status (Gambetta, 2005). This belief still remains in modern-day Japan. The concept of joining the ancestors to protect Japan in death may have encouraged young men to volunteer for the KA (Gambetta, 2005). However, this link to religion should not be overplayed. Gambetta (2005) argues that the Japanese infantrymen had little regard for Buddhism and even less for Shintō. Therefore, for many men in the KA, religion may not have played an integral role (Gambetta, 2005).
</p>

<p>
Religion is also a key focus of the IS. The IS aims to create a united caliphate under Sharia law (Islamic law) (Nacim, 2016). Their version of Islam is highly militarized and revolves around the concept of offensive Jihad. The IS claim that they want to return Muslims to the authentic roots of Islam which will bring them rewards in the afterlife (Al-Ghazzi, 2017) and that those who kill infidels whilst killing themselves will be rewarded by Allah in paradise (Warraq, 2005). Therefore, religion seems to be an integral part of the motivations behind SM for the IS. However, Sageman (2004) argues that suicide bombers in general do not carry out the mission for religious reasons. Sageman states that psychological and personal reasons are more powerful and prominent. This means that although religion plays a role in both KA and IS SM the motivational reasons for engaging in SM for both kamikaze pilots and IS suicide actors may be more complex than simply a reflection of religious beliefs.
</p>

<p>
In addition to any promised rewards in the afterlife, both kamikaze pilots and IS suicide actors may have been/be motivated by the promise of being immortalized in the physical world by becoming a martyr. Counter-intuitively, the act of suicide by both the Kamikaze pilots and IS SM actors may be motivated by their need/desire to live forever (Kruglanski et al., 2009). Martyrdom is considered the act of killing or dying for one's religious or other beliefs (Pedahzur, 2006; Jensen et al., 2003). Individuals who commit suicide for martyrdom reasons, therefore, do not considered themselves to be dead, but rather immortalized (Bukay, 2006). The concept of martyrdom was introduced into the formal Japanese education system in 1931. Military education was compulsory and taught students to be obedient to the Emperor and nation. Military lectures and training programmes (introduced in 1931 and 1939) were used to encourage and cultivate a sense/attitude of patriotism and patriotic martyrdom, with the intention of preparing children/civilians/soldiers to be ready to die for their Emperor (Iritani, 1991). In addition to this education context, suicide is also held in high regard in Japan. It is seen as an honorable act to escape an impossible situation. For example, classical suicide inflicted by the self-disembowelment of the warrior (seppuku) is seen as a powerful act of courage, integrity and serenity, leading Japanese men who died in this way to be venerated (Gambetta, 2005). This combination of heightened notions of patriotism and the concept of suicide as honourable, is likely to have encouraged young people to want to die for their country, so that they would be considered martyrs. The concept of immortality is key. The term 'kami' means divine/God wind, which reflects the relationship between the pilots and the concept of their becoming higher beings through the KA (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2018). However, evidence suggests that not all kamikaze pilots were motivated to engage in the SM for the status of martyrdom. The writings of some students who died in the KA expressed views that did not uncritically endorse the idea of patriotic martyrdom and the readiness to die for the Emperor. Some students engaged in the KA to expel foreign colonialism (as America was looking to invade the Japan in 1945) (Zaloga, 2011) rather than for a sense of martyrdom. This suggests that although the notion of martyrdom may have been a significant motivator for many kamikaze pilots (Gambetta, 2005), it may not have been the principle or sole motivator.
</p>

<p>
IS fighters also believe that they will become martyrs of the cause (Hafez, 2006). Abu Umar al-Baghdadi (the leader of the IS) even states that the IS is so successful because of its use of suicide bombers turned martyrs (Perry & Long, 2016). The IS propagates this martyr narrative to new young recruits through online videos distributed through social media (Perry & Long, 2016). Like the Kamikaze pilots, the concept of attaining immortality through martyrdom (shahadat) is key to the suicide bomber's motivations. The ordinary militant who dies fighting for the 'cause' is not remembered among the dead. They are part of an army, all carrying out the same task, where individuals are routinely overlooked in their death. Some people in terrorist organizations and wars thus may choose to become a martyr as this immortalizes them, rewarding them with recognition and fame (Ricolfi, 2005). Male jihadists fighting for the IS believe that if they kill countless people while killing themselves they will be remembered as a martyr who died for the cause (Hafez, 2006). Therefore, as with many kamikaze pilots, the concept of martyrdom may have been integral to the decision to engage in SM.
</p>

<h3>Obedience to higher authority</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
 SM may be carried out in response to the will of a higher power. In some cases, the kamikaze pilots were reportedly sacrificing their lives for the 'God Emperor' (Inuzuka, 2016) emphasizing his status and authority. This sacrifice therefore, highlights the extreme obedience to the perceived highest authority of the land. This shares similarities with the IS. The IS claim that they are creating a state where all are obedient to the word of Allah through the Qur'an and the Hadith (Ganor, 2000). This reflects the connection with the Kamikaze pilots and their unquestioning obedience to a higher authority, the Emperor.
</p>

<p>
Obedience to a higher authority was/is attained through systematic indoctrination strategies for both the Kamikaze pilots and the IS. There is evidence to suggest that indoctrination was/is strategically used on both the kamikaze pilots and the IS suicide actors. By 1886, educational reform had taken place in Japan with a heavy focus on militarization. This new education system emphasized government control of the Japanese people through militaristic outlooks and group cohesion. The Emperor became a figure of ultimate authority and the education system prioritized nation and Emperor as the most important aspects of life. Following from 1894 (the Sino-Japanese war), the school curriculum became more patriotic and nationalistic and emphasized themes of war. Duty to the Emperor became the highest honour (Spinks, 1944). In 1925, after WW1, the military became integral to the school curriculum. Military officers were stationed in every middle/high school and each student had to complete 2 hours of military training every week, attend five/six hours of military instruction a week including lectures on the importance of dying for Japan and the Emperor, and were required to attend a week long military-training camp each year. During WW2, potential candidates (often young) were screened to become kamikaze pilots (Rielly, 2010). These students were taught not how to fight but how to die (Ohnuki-Tierney, 2007). 'Training consisted of practicing take-offs and diving on target. No attempt was made to teach the prospective pilots to land; the instructor took over and brought the plan down' (Rielly, 2010, p 11). By only teaching how to take-off and not land the plane, this instruction was training pilots in how to die for their country/Emperor.
</p>

<p>
Obedience to a higher authority through indoctrination is also key to IS. By indoctrinating child IS fighters, they are likely to obey commands and show unquestioning loyalty to the teachers, the IS and to Allah. Children are used as traditional fighters, wilayats (suicide bombers), spies, preachers and executioners. Formal schooling is compulsory for children in IS-controlled areas. The rules are strictly imposed and any teacher opposing the curriculum is executed or abducted. Children that refuse to obey orders are reportedly raped, tortured or flogged (Benotman & Malik, 2016). It was reported in 2015 that there were 19 cases of children being used in SM (Benotman & Malik, 2016). Although adults are also indoctrinated, due to the young age of the children recruited in IS, the indoctrination is likely to be more intense and effective.
</p>

<p>
Benotman and Malik (2016) outline five child indoctrination tactics used by the IS. The first is how children join the IS, this is either through abduction (direct coercion) or out of fear (indirect, systematic coercion). Secondly, children are then indoctrinated either from birth (31,000 women were pregnant in the 'caliphate') or as young children. Thirdly, schools are used as a primary form of indoctrination. The intensity of the indoctrination increases when the children are between 10 and 15 years old when they attend military training camps. They are taught to become desensitized to violence including witnessing crucifixions, beheadings and stonings and also to defend the violence perpetrated by the IS. Fourth, subjects such as nationalism, history, and social studies are prohibited in schools and the children are taught to memorize verses from the Qur'an. The boys have to attend military 'jihad training' which includes learning to shoot, to use and handle different weaponry, and learning martial arts. Finally, to complete the indoctrination cycle, children are not able to criticize the caliphate and have to propagate the caliphate when they become adults. Therefore, both the kamikaze pilots and the IS used/use indoctrination methods to develop their 'soldiers' willingness to die for the sake of a higher authority, either through the Emperor in Japan or Allah for the IS.
</p>

<h3>Peer pressure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Peer pressure can motivate people to engage in certain behaviours (Hoorne et al., 2016). The concepts of peer pressure and group values are inevitably intertwined. Group values and the tradition of Japan primarily focus on the bushido code emphasizing warrior-spirit, loyalty and courage. This was based on the Samurai code (Rielly, 2010). Therefore, when a young Japanese man was asked to volunteer for the kamikaze, it would have been difficult for him to have said no. The wider society, his family and friends would all have approved of the mission because of the group values held through tradition (Rielly, 2010). Culturally Japan is considered a collectivist society (Hofstede Insights, 2018). Conformity, therefore, was valued during the time of the KA and it would have been seen as unacceptable and an insult if the individual went against the group beliefs and values (Rielly, 2010). This is similarly seen in IS recruits. As discussed above, children are generally abducted or coerced into fighting for the IS and are recruited into 'Jihadist training camps' between the ages of 10-15 (Benotman & Malik, 2016). It is likely that because of the young age of IS recruits, the approval of peers plays a significant role (Gommans et al., 2017). Children are often recruited through seeing other children/their friends propagating the IS through fighting, parading or socializing (Benotman & Malik, 2016). If children are likely to join the IS to join their friends and become like them, this suggests that peer approval is important for these recruits. The IS also propagates a collectivist society, similar to that of Japan (Hofstede Insights, 2018). For Japan, a nationalistic identity reflects collectivism. For the IS, the collectivist identity is not contained within one geographical country and therefore in the official IS school curriculum, subjects such as nationalism are prohibited to prevent an nationalist ideology forming creating ethnic divides in the IS (Benotman & Malik, 2016). This collectivist narrative may make peer approval more important when joining the IS or becoming involved in SM as the children are thinking about the collective, rather the individual (Chen et al., 2006).
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Although there are differences between the KA and the current use of SM by the IS relating to their specific historical, socio-cultural and political contexts, there are also some similarities in the general characteristics of the tactics used by the KA and the IS SM. The main general characteristics that are shared by these two forms of attacks are: the nature of the mission (SM), the expectation not to survive, the focus on military targets, and their use of vehicles. Motivation is also an important factor, which reflects similarities between kamikaze pilots and the IS SM actors. Rielly's Three Factor model outlines the importance of group values and tradition, religion and martyrdom. Obedience to authority through indoctrination and peer pressure resulting from collectivist attitudes and conformity. This model highlights the similarities with the IS revealing that there are some general characteristics of the KA that apply to the current terrorist threat from the IS. There are not only operational characteristics that are similar, but also motivational characteristics that are shared. These operational and motivational factors may have led pilots and fighters to engage in the KA during WW2 and those same factors may underpin and help explain why members of the IS become actors in SM today.

<h1>'The concept of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had its origins in the First World War, discuss.'</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Trauma is a side-effect of war and can have detrimental life-long effects (Holdeman, 2009). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder triggered by traumatic experiences (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), which manifests though intrusive flashbacks, difficulty concentrating, alexithymia, and other anxiety-related symptoms (Smith et al., 2008). Although research presents disparate prevalence rates of PTSD, the prevalence rate in soldiers returning from the 2001 Afghanistan/2003 Iraq wars, is estimated to be between 5-20% (Ramchand et al., 2010), which highlights the seriousness of the disorder. PTSD is triggered by trauma, and trauma has historically manifested itself in several ways. For example, Shell Shock (SS), a disorder first seen in World War One (WW1), was one of the disorders manifested through trauma (Shepherd, 2002). SS affected 80,000 British soldiers by the end of WW1 (Beveridge, 1997). Symptoms included recurring nightmares and the inability to walk, talk, reason, and sleep (Loughran, 2017). Although the complexity of the title question above demands a more intricate analysis of trauma, in order to discuss the origins of PTSD in this essay, the division between organic and psychological causes, and the forerunners of PTSD pre-WW1 will be addressed.
</p>

<h3>Physiological vs Psychological causes of PTSD</h3>
<p>
PTSD is unique in its classification as it is the only functional disorder which is categorized by its aetiology (Al-Saffer, Borgå, Edman, & Hällström, 2003). The divide, therefore, between organic and psychological cause in the aetiology of SS is important to establish the origins of PTSD. The argument relating to the organic versus psychological causes of trauma led to a myriad of disorders used to describe similar symptomology leading to further confusion (Trimble, 1985). These disorders included railway spine, soldiers heart, hysteria etc (Young, 1997). In early WW1, SS was understood to be organic in nature and hypothesised to be caused by either the impact of exploding bombs (Tucker & Trautman, 2000) or by carbon monoxide causing damage to the nervous system (Shepherd, 2002). However, an opposing psychological aetiology of SS gained momentum towards the later stages of WW1. Myers hypothesised that SS was due to psychological trauma, not organic injury (Myers, 1915). SS was therefore divided into two schools of thought, physical versus psychological.
</p>

<h3>Opposing schools of thought</h3>
<p>
These schools of thought can be seen in the divisions observed in the classification of Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and PTSD. mTBI is an organic disorder resulting from a bomb blast causing disorientation or loss of consciousness for 30 minutes or less (Bryant, 2011). mTBI is considered to be the signature injury from the Afghanistan/Iraq wars, much the same as SS was the signature injury of WW1 (Jones, Fear, Phil & Wessely, 2007). This shows a relationship between the earlier hypothesised organic aetiology of SS and mTBI. The second school of thought representing the psychological aetiology can be seen to manifest itself in the prognosis of PTSD. The classification of PTSD has a psychological cause with no organic damage (Breslau, 2009).
</p>

<h3>Organic cause of PTSD</h3>
<p>
However, although PTSD is classified as a psychiatric disorder caused by psychological trauma, recent research suggests that PTSD may also have an organic cause. Soldiers within the vicinity of an improvised explosive device (IED) blast in Afghanistan/Iraq, diagnosed with PTSD, show signs of organic nerve damage from the IED, effecting areas that control executive functions (Ryu et al., 2015; Alexander, 2016). Research also observed anatomical structural changes in the hippocampus after a psychologically traumatic event leading to hippocampal atrophy (Karl et al., 2006). Although the causal relationship of this atrophy is unknown, this complicates the cause of PTSD, and the clear distinction between PTSD and mTBI. PTSD and mTBI are often comorbid and can share bilateral anterior amygdala volume reduction leading to the same symptomology. These symptoms can include poor inhibitory control and increased impulsivity (Depue et al., 2014). Neuroscience technology has only recently enabled examination of the organic origins of mTBI (Belanger, Vanderploeg, Curtiss, & Warden, 2007) suggesting that all trauma may have an organic cause, but may be undetectable due to the limitations in technology. However, the lack of consistent methodology in neuroimaging research relating to mTBI makes interpretation of neuroimaging findings difficult (Belanger, Vanderploeg, Curtiss, & Warden, 2007) and therefore further research into mTBI needs to be conducted to understand the organic nature of the injury. The above organic causal examples suggest that distinguishing mTBI and PTSD can be difficult as it continues the debate regarding the causal nature of trauma (Elder, Mitsis, Ahlers, & Christian, 2010). It is likely, therefore, PTSD does have its origins in SS (Loughran, 2012) but so may other trauma-related disorders, such as mTBI.
</p>

<h3>Forerunners</h3>
<p>
Although SS was the signature trauma-disorder associated with PTSD, there are other potential forerunners of PTSD predating WW1. For example, the early disorders, hysteria and neurasthenia (Beveridge, 1997) share symptoms with SS including exhaustion, confusion, and repetitive nightmares (Loughran, 2008). LeDoux (1992) suggested that the neurosis elicited from hysteria was caused by a block between the amygdala and the hippocampus leading to an inability to process stimuli, sharing similarities with modern-day neuroimaging findings of the neurobiological changes in PTSD (Yovell, 2000). However, hysteria was traditionally diagnosed as a female disorder and during the beginning of WW1, was only diagnosed to men in the ranks. Officers who displayed the same symptoms were diagnosed with neurasthenia which elicited a sympathetic reaction and therapeutic response (Loughran, 2008). This shows the class and gender division in psychiatric diagnosis. Due to the stigma associated with the terms hysteria and neurasthenia, a new disorder was classified named SS (Moose, 2000). Both hysteria and neurasthenia were considered functional disorders due to their apparent psychological cause (Loughran, 2008) sharing similarities with PTSD. Due to the newness of the psychiatric discipline pre-WW1, many modern-day disorders may have been categorized under either hysteria or neurasthenia diagnoses, and as a result, it is difficult to compare early diagnoses to modern trauma-related illness (Dayan & Olliac, 2010). It could therefore be argued that most modern psychiatric illnesses, including PTSD, originated from hysteria or neurasthenia or their predecessors.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The aetiology of PTSD seems to have its origins in the psychological interpretation of SS. However, due to confused diagnosis relating to aetiology, the organic and psychological causes of trauma are unable to be separated. It is therefore difficult to assess the causal origins of PTSD, as these historical disorders manifested themselves in different ways and often overlapped. This implies that further analysis of historical disorders is needed in order to begin to address the origins of contemporary trauma-related disorders such as PTSD.

<h1><u>Current threat from The Islamic State</u></h1>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
  Since airstrikes have increased, the Islamic state has been loosing territory fast. There power has dimishised and their effectiveness is also declining.
  In 2016, at the heigher of their power, the Islamic state 26 people per day. In 2018, so far the number of people killed so far world-wise
  by the Islamic State is 5. That is 21 people less per day in 2 years. The Islamic state's power is diminishing but they are still considered
  an international terrorism threat.

<h1><u>Current threat from far-right extremism</u></h1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
  The Far-right threat is the Western world is a threat that for the most part has been overlooked. Most Western countries have between
  preoccupied with their focus on Islamist terrorism coming from organizations like the Islamic State. Although Islamists statistically do
  pose a more serious threat to the Western world, the far-right extremist threat has become a problem in the UK, Europe and the US. There
  are many reasons for the rise of the far-right from immigration to Islamist terrorism, and this form of extremism and terrorism is now demanding our focus.
